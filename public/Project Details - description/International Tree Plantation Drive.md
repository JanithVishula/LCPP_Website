Project Description
Show this section
The Leo Club of Pannipitiya Paradise proudly participated in the International Tree Plantation Drive 5.0, a global environmental initiative organized by the Leo Club of Diphu Aspire – Leo District 322 D. This international project aimed to promote environmental awareness, encourage reforestation and build a sense of global unity among Leo Clubs through a shared commitment to sustainability.



Under this International project , our leo club successfully planted over 30 plants across various home gardens and local plots. By choosing easily maintainable locations and involving individual members in the planting process, the project emphasized the importance of personal accountability and continuous care in environmental conservation.



The initiative was coordinated under the dedicated leadership of the Organizing Committee:

Chairperson: Leo Lion Winnath Edirisooriya
Secretary: Leo Janith Vishula
Treasurer: Leo Matheesha De Silva


A well-documented poster featuring photographs of members actively engaged in planting was designed and submitted as part of the project reporting process. In recognition of its meaningful contribution, the Leo Club of Pannipitiya Paradise was acknowledged among over 20 Leo Clubs worldwide that took part in this international effort.



This project was carried out in twinning with several Leo Clubs across different regions, including:

Leo Club Khandawa Sparkle
Leo Club of University of Sri Jayewardenepura
Leo Club of Colombo Downtown Alliance
Leo Club of Moratuwa
Leo Club of Gauhati
Leo Club of Nallur
Leo Club of Noakhali
LEO Club of Chittagong Rose Valley
Leo Club of Guwahati South
Leo Club of University of Colombo
Leo Club of Royal College


Through this initiative, the Leo Club of Pannipitiya Paradise not only contributed to enhancing green cover but also strengthened international Leo fellowship and demonstrated its commitment to global causes. The project stands as a testament to how simple individual actions, when united, can create a significant positive impact on the environment
