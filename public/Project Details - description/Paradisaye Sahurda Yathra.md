Benefiting Community	
The beneficiaries of this project were individuals and families affected by severe flooding in various parts of Sri Lanka. The floods caused displacement, destruction of homes, loss of livelihoods and interruption of access to basic necessities.



The primary benefiting groups included:

Low-income families whose homes and belongings were damaged or destroyed
Daily wage earners who lost their source of income due to the disaster
Elderly individuals, children, and persons with special needs who were highly vulnerable during the flood situation


By supporting organized relief distribution, the project indirectly benefited a wide geographical area covering multiple flood-affected regions, ensuring assistance reached communities with the greatest need.

Identified Community Need	
The floods resulted in an immediate humanitarian crisis, creating an urgent need for:

Food and drinking water
Clothing and basic household items
Medical and hygiene supplies
Financial assistance for emergency relief


Many affected families were unable to recover on their own due to limited financial resources. Government and relief agencies required additional support from community organizations to meet the increasing demand for aid. The situation highlighted the need for timely financial contributions to strengthen relief distribution efforts and reach affected populations efficiently.

Service Opportunity	
The disaster created a meaningful service opportunity for the Leo Club of Pannipitiya Paradise to contribute to national relief efforts. As a youth-oriented service organization committed to humanitarian values, the club recognized its responsibility to respond promptly to the crisis.



Rather than operating independently, the club identified the value of partnering with an established and trusted relief initiative to ensure transparency, efficiency, and maximum impact. This approach allowed the club to play a supportive role while ensuring that donations were distributed professionally and equitably among flood victims.

Mode of Data Collection	
The identification of the community need and planning of the project were based on information collected through multiple sources, including:

Continuous media coverage and disaster reports highlighting flood-affected areas
Updates and appeals issued by recognized disaster relief initiatives
Direct communication and coordination with representatives of Sirasa Sahana Yathra
Observations and discussions among Leo Club members regarding the severity of the situation
These data sources enabled the club to understand the urgency of the crisis and determine the most effective method of contribution.

Project Description
Show this section
The Leo Club of Pannipitiya Paradise initiated a flood relief donation drive in response to the ongoing flood situation affecting several regions across Sri Lanka. Recognizing the urgency of the crisis, club members actively engaged with the general public to raise awareness about the disaster and encourage voluntary monetary contributions. Donations were collected through well-organized efforts, ensuring transparency, accountability and proper documentation throughout the process.



This meaningful initiative was primarily driven by Leo Anuga Kumarajeewa, Leo Lion Matheesha, Leo Lion Onel Herath and Leo Hasindu Induwara, whose dedication and commitment played a vital role in the successful execution of the project. Their leadership and teamwork ensured smooth coordination and effective public engagement during the donation campaign.



Upon completion of the collection phase, the total funds raised were officially handed over to Sirasa Sahana Yathra, a nationally recognized disaster relief initiative renowned for its structured and impactful relief distribution programs. The organization undertook the responsibility of utilizing the donated funds to provide essential relief items and assistance to flood victims across affected areas.



Through this project, the Leo Club of Pannipitiya Paradise made a meaningful contribution to national disaster relief efforts while reinforcing the core values of compassion, unity, and selfless service. The initiative not only supported communities in immediate need but also strengthened the club’s image as a responsible, proactive, and socially committed youth service organization.
